General fabrication notes

	Boards should be individually routed. Total order is ten boards.
	
	Dielectric is standard FR4 with a minimum Tg of 180C.

	The Multech logo and date code should be placed on the BACK side of the board

	Blue LPI solder mask on both sides of board. Mask clearance 50 μm around all NSMD pads.
	
	White LPI legend on both sides of board. Resolution should be sufficient to ensure readability of the smallest text.
	
	Pad finish is ENIG.
	
	All vias should be filled with non-conductive epoxy and plated over.
	
	Manufacture should be compliant with IPC class 2 standards.
	
	DEBUG NOTES:
	139 um/ps for outer
	159 um/ps for inner
	
Impedances

	Control to within 10%.

	Layer 1 microstrip (ref to layer 2 ground)
		127 μm					  = 50 ohms single ended
		100 μm trace / 150 μm gap = 100 ohms differential

	Layer 3 stripline (ref to layer 2 ground)
		127 μm					  = 50 ohms single ended
		100 μm trace / 150 μm gap = 100 ohms differential

	Layer 6 stripline (ref to layer 7 ground)
		127 μm					  = 50 ohms single ended
		100 μm trace / 150 μm gap = 100 ohms differential
		
	Layer 8 microstrip (ref to layer 7 ground)
		127 μm					  = 50 ohms single ended
		100 μm trace / 150 μm gap = 100 ohms differential

Design rules

	Minimum trace/space
		127 μm clearance / 100 μm trace

	Minimum through-board via
		450 μm pad, 250 μm drill

Stackup
	Prepreg thicknesses between layers 3/4 and 5/6 may be adjusted to obtain 1.6mm finished thickness.
