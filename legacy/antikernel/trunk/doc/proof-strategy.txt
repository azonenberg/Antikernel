Base DMA transceiver always produces valid packets

Base DMA transceiver always correctly decodes valid packets

RPC router forwarding delay is bounded if network isn't blocked

DMA router forwarding delay is bounded if network isn't blocked

RPC router always properly forwards packets

DMA router always properly forwards packets

BlockRAMAllocator will not block network
	Total time spent with drx_ready == 0 is bounded (may not be true if RPC is spammed nonstop?)
	Total time spent between rpc_rx_en and rpc_rx_done is bounded

BlockRAMAllocator state machine logic is correct
	DMA read
		If invalid DMA (crosses page boundary, unaligned, not multiple of one cache line)
			return RPC fail interrupt
			do not touch any state
		Read ownership records for page
		If owner matches packet source
			send DMA packet with proper address/length
			read len words from requested address
		if not
			return RPC fail interrupt
			do not touch state		
	
	DMA write
		If invalid DMA (crosses page boundary, unaligned, not multiple of one cache line)
			return RPC fail interrupt
			do not touch any state
		Read ownership records for page
		If owner matches packet source
			write frame_length words to memory starting from packet source
			TODO: figure out how to stream without copying
		if not
			return RPC fail interrupt
			do not touch state
	
	Invalid DMA
		Does not modify state
		Does not transmit any packets
		
	RPC allocate
		Returns the next cycle (if currently idle, otherwise can block up to Nmax cycles)
		Does not touch storage memory
		If all pages allocated
			returns fail
			does not touch ownership records or free list
		If there is free memory
			returns success
			returns address in free list head
			writes source address to ownership record of that page ID
			pops free list		
	
	RPC free
		Reads owner of requested page
		If owner == source address
			returns success
			pushes page ID onto free list
			writes page ID to ownership memory with owner == self
			
		else
			returns fail
			does not touch ownership records, free list, or storage memory
	
	RPC chown
		Reads owner of requested page
		If owner == source address
			returns success
			writes page ID to ownership memory with requested owner
		else
			returns fail
			does not touch ownership records, free list, or storage memory
	
	Invalid RPC
		Returns fail
		Does not modify core state
