General fabrication notes

	Boards should be individually routed. Total order is six units, or MOQ if this is more than six.

	Lot number / date codes should be placed on the bottom side of the board.

	Blue LPI solder mask on both sides of board. Mask clearance 50 μm around all NSMD pads.
	
	White LPI legend on both sides of board. Resolution should be sufficient to ensure readability of the smallest text.
	
	Pad finish is ENIG.

	Core/prepreg thickness may be adjusted as needed to obtain 1.6 mm finished thickness and target impedances.
	
Impedances

	Control to within 10%.

	Layer 1 microstrip (ref to layer 2 ground)
		123 μm = 50 ohm
		110 μm = 100 ohm differential

	Layer 4 microstrip (ref to layer 3 ground)
		123 μm = 50 ohm
		110 μm = 100 ohm differential
		
Design rules

	Minimum trace/space
		125 μm clearance / 110 μm trace

	Minimum through-board via
		500 μm pad, 250 μm drill
