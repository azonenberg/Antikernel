Part number:		cat5-tdr r1703
	
General fabrication notes

	* Boards are be individually routed.
	* Substrate is FR4 suitable for lead-free reflow.
	* Lot number / date codes should be placed on the back side of the board.
	* Blue LPI solder mask on both sides of board. All vias to be tented.
	* White LPI legend on both sides of board.
	* Pad finish is ENIG.
	* Finished board thickness is 1.6 mm.
	* Electrical testing requested.
	* Soldermask apertures over differential pairs are test points, to be left intact
		
Impedances

	Control to within 10%.

	Layer 1 microstrip (ref to layer 2 ground)
		140 μm tracks / 125 μm space = 100 ohm differential

	Layer 4 microstrip (ref to layer 3 power plane)
		140 μm tracks / 125 μm space = 100 ohm differential
